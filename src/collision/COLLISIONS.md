In order for Orientated Bounding Box to be calculated using the Separated Axis Theorem, a crucial modification must be added to the usual 2D implementation of the theorem. The S.A.T. projects the vertices of 2 meshes onto the collection of both of their normals, and converts a 2D collision problem into several 1D collision problems. If the projected vertices of the meshes indicate a collision on all the normals of both meshes, it is thus imperative that a 2D collision has occured. In 3 dimensions, however, due to the meshes having to not only deal with face and vertex collisions, but also edge collisions, we must use not only the combined collection of the normals of both meshes in 3d, but also the cross product between each of the normals of the collider and the collided. As such, the produced overhead of an O.B.B. in 3d is nigh 4 times higher than that produced in 2d, having to calculate 15 projections and intersection detections, instead of simply 4.
