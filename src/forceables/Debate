Although the Newtonian space has been one that has been agreed upon
by many scientists and people alike for centuries now, there is still 
uncertainty as to its physical credibility, as the Newtonian suggestion
that Time is a fourth dimension to space has yet to be physically
proven. The Newtonian description of space and time is also not the only
description out there, hence my adaptation of the universe would have to
be a preference between the different explanations floating out there.

My current topics of consideration are that of the debate between the
Newtonian SpaceTime, supported by basically hundreds of scientists all
over the globe, and the 3 dimensional SPaceTime proposed by Sorli,
Fiscaletti, and Klinar as well as many other scientists across history.
The latter is also supported by the Hamiltonian dynamics and other
